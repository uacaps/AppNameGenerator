AppNameGenerator
================

A little web-app to generate project names from a list of user-defined buzzwords.

Usage
=====

Users can add buzz words, prefixes, postfixes (suffixes), and both minimum and maximum syllable lengths for the app names. Also, if a combination of buzzwords would result in an acronym that can be represented by a real word, it will also show that as a result.
